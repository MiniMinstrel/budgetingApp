# budgetingApp
A basic budgeting app that I'm developing.

Rough Dev Plan.
Step 1: Build out a POC. The bare minimum, no need for crazy styling. Build out the minimum work you need to make the idea work.
Step 2: Style up the dashboard. Get all the styling you want for it out of the way.
Step 3: Build in authentication. You don't need a landing page yet (or at all really), but authentication helps stand this above the rest.
